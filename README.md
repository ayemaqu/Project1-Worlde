## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- I had trouble understanding what the syntax is, what it means. It felt really fast paced, to have all this code in front of me, but swift is completely new so I understand why it seems that way
- Exercise 3 was challenging because I didn't understand the closure part, I still don't...
